    <p>DynaStat is a personal passion project that I started in August of my junior year. 
      It is intended to serve doctors in underserved countries, such as the Bahamas and Haiti. 
      These doctors may not have the financial resources in order to purchase software licenses 
        from big healthcare companies such as Epic and Praxis EMR. So, once fully programmed and set up, 
        DynaStat will offer similar services for uploading and recording patient data in order to raise 
        the quality of medical care that patients receive. </p>
    <p>I hope in the future to grow DynaStat into a non-profit, that takes its net revenue after the 
      website costs have been paid and reinvests that money into medical tools and equipment, that can 
      then be donated to these doctors who need these vital resources.</p>
